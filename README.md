# my-codequiz
I am going to create an application called codequiz. Its a codequiz for fundamental javascript. Basically the application is timed and it would ask few questions for which the user will click one of the options. If the options are correct, it will display correct or wrong answer. Also at the end of the quiz it will score your score and ask you to enter name. 

The second part of this codequiz is the highscore, where I will be using a second html file called highscore which shows the highscores of all quiz takers. 

First Version: 
design: I have created a repository which contains index.hml, higscore.html, style.css, highscore.css and script.js and README.md.
step1: first page of application working: when user clicks startcode quiz button on index.html, the form clears and new elements are created dynamically and added to the body. The screenshot of first two pages :are included in issues.
